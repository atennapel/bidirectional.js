# bidirectional.js
Javascript and Typescript implementations of "Complete and Easy Bidirectional Type Checking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism"

This is an almost direct translation of https://github.com/ollef/Bidirectional

See `ts-mutable` for the most up-to-date implementation.

See `scoped.js` for a minimal implementation of type inference for predicative System F.
See `scoped.fc.js` for a minimal implementation of a bidirectional version of HMF (invariant but impredicative instantiations).
See `nary.js` for the most up-to-date implementation of impredicative System F.
