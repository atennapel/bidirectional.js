This directory contains experiments in extending the basic type system of
"Complete and Easy Bidirectional Type Checking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism".

* Kinds (at the moment not infered and not polymorphic)
* TCon for simple types (Int, Bool, Str etc.)
* TApp for type applications (List Int, forall t . List t)
